      <p className="text-xl">Hi everyone! I'm Mattie and welcome to my hand embroidery page.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Born and raised in Augusta, Georgia, I've always been a creative at heart, dabbling in as many mediums as possible while growing up. So it definitely surprised my mom when I decided to pursue a business
        degree in uni, where I had little to no creative outlet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Despite having artistic side projects going on for as long as I can
        remember, I always felt it was "just a hobby" and a business degree was
        the more practical (and lucrative) path.
      </p>

        Fast forward to 2019, when I relocated to Berlin. Without a doubt, being in a city
        overflowing with creatives inspired me to more actively pursue my
        creative passion projects. I started doing a lot more sketching and hand
        embroidery, and during the 2020 lockdown I stitched my first fruit vulva as
        a gift for a friend.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A few years later and I have over 20 fruit designs, have
        shipped my art across the globe, created multiple embroidery guides,
        and now here I am, making this website to keep sharing my art with you all ðŸ’š
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I love getting to share the beauty of modern embroidery with everyone
        while also making vulvas look ridiculously cute.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="custom-font text-2xl tracking-widest">Enjoy!</p>
