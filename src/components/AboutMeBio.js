      <p className="text-xl">Hi everyone! I'm Mattie and welcome to my hand embroidery page.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Born and raised in Augusta, Georgia, I've always been a creative at
        heart but got a bit side-tracked when I decided to pursue a business
        degree in uni and ended up in some less-than-fulfilling 9-to-5 roles
        with virtually no opportunity for growth or creativity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Despite having creative side projects going on for as long as I can
        remember, I always felt it was "just a hobby" and a business degree was
        the more practical path.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2019, I relocated to Berlin. Without a doubt, being in a city
        overflowing with creatives inspired me to more actively pursue my
        creative passion projects. I started doing a lot more sketching and hand
        embroidery, and during 2020 lockdown I stitched my first fruit vulva as
        a gift for a friend.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Fast forward a couple years and I have over 20 fruit designs, have
        shipped my art across the globe, created a variety of embroidery guides,
        and now here I am, making this website to sell my art to you all ❤️
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I love being able to share the beauty of modern embroidery with everyone
        while also making vulvas look ridiculously cute.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="custom-font text-2xl tracking-widest">Enjoy!</p>
